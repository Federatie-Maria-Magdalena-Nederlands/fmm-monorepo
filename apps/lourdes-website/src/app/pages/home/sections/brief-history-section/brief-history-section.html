        The history of the Lourdes parish and the St. Bavo Church cannot be
        counted in years, but must be counted in centuries
      </p>
      <p class="text-xl text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        For decades, the Church of Our Lady of Lourdes has been a familiar
        beacon of faith, hope, and community in the neighborhood. Built during a
        period of post-war reconstruction, the church has grown into a vibrant
        parish where people from diverse backgrounds gather around their faith.
      </p>
      <p class="text-xl text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        The church is named after Mary of Lourdes, a symbol of comfort, prayer,
        and miracles. This spirit of closeness and care is still palpable in
        every celebration, meeting, and activity within our community. Over the
        years, the Lourdes Church has remained not only a place of worship, but
        also of solidarity, encounter, and inspiration – right in the heart of
        the city.
      </p>
      <p class="text-xl text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
        Today, we continue to build on this rich history, with an eye to the
        future and space for everyone who feels called to participate.
