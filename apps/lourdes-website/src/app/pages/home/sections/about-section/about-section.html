      For decades, the Church of Our Lady of Lourdes has been a familiar beacon
      of faith, hope, and community in the neighborhood. Built during a period
      of post-war reconstruction, the church has grown into a vibrant parish
      where people from diverse backgrounds gather around their faith.

          <b>A missionary with a warm heart for people</b>
        </p>
        <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          Father Cândido Luhuma, born in Benguela, Angola, is a priest of the
          Congregation of the Holy Spirit (CSSp). His vocation began at a young
          age, inspired by missionaries in his native country. After his
          formation in the Netherlands, including in Gennep, Berg en Dal, and
          Handel, he was ordained a priest on October 16, 2016.
        </p>
        <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          With his warm personality and commitment to people, he began his
          pastoral work at the Saint Willibrord Parish in Gemert-Bakel. There,
          he was active among young people, in catechesis, and in the local
          Brazilian community. His dedication was widely appreciated, and in
          2024, he was transferred to our parish.
        </p>
        <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          Father Cândido is also deeply involved with Catholic youth in the
          Netherlands. He is the coordinator for the youth apostolate in the
          Netherlands, is active in Alpha Netherlands, and is the founder of
          Soulfire (a Catholic youth group that meets twice a month).
        </p>
        <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          Currently, Father Cândido is active in the Maria Magdalena federation,
          primarily serving the Lourdes Parish and St. Augustine Parish in
          Barendrecht, and assisting the Portuguese-speaking community in The
          Hague. He sees his calling as a lifelong commitment to be close to
          people and make God's love tangible—especially for young people and
          those seeking help.
