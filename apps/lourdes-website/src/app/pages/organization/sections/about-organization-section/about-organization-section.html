      The parish structure hasn't changed significantly with the federation.
      It's more of a shift in responsibilities. The parish council has delegated
      a number of tasks to the federation level. The pastoral group has been
      given more responsibility and has become the pastoral heart of the parish.
    </p>

    <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
      The need for cooperation is dictated by a shortage of priests and the
      declining number of volunteers. In the new organisation there is a
      personal union and a federation. By joining forces in certain areas, it
      remains possible to serve five parishes and keep them independent.
