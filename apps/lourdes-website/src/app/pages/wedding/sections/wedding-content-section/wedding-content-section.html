        Marriage is a sacred covenant of love, fidelity, and commitment. When
        two people exchange vows in God's presence, they promise not only to
        love each other but also to grow together in faith and connection.
      </p>

      <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
