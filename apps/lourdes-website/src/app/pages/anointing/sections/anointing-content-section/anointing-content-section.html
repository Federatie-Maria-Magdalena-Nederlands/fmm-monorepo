        The <strong>Anointing</strong> of the Sick is a sign of God's closeness,
        love, and comfort in times of illness or vulnerability. It is a sacred
        moment in which the priest prays for strength, healing, and inner peace,
        and the sick person is anointed with consecrated oil.
      </p>

      <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        This sacrament brings hope and peace—not only to the sick person, but
        also to those around them. It reminds us that we are never alone: God is
        with us, especially in moments of sorrow and pain.
