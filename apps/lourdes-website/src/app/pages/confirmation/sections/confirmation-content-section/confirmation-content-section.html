        Confirmation is a special moment in your faith journey—a sacrament in
        which you are strengthened by the Holy Spirit and consciously confirm
        your faith. It is a step of maturity, commitment, and connection with
        the Church community.

        At <strong>Lourdes Parish</strong>, we want to prepare for this special
        moment together with you, with care, warmth, and faith, through
        catechesis, fellowship, and celebration. During the preparation, you
        discover the meaning of faith, friendship, and love, and you learn what
        it means to be a conscious Christian.
