        Volunteering in our parish is a wonderful way to share your time,
        talents, and gifts while building meaningful connections with fellow
        parishioners. Whether you have a few hours a week or can commit to a
        regular ministry, there's a place for you to serve.

      <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        Our volunteers are the heartbeat of our parish community. Through their
        dedicated service, they help create a welcoming environment, support
        worship celebrations, care for those in need, and ensure our parish runs
        smoothly. Every contribution, no matter how small, makes a significant
        impact.
