        Ordination is a special vocation: a choice to dedicate one's life
        entirely to God and the community. Through the sacrament of Holy Orders,
        one is called to become a priest, deacon, or bishop—a sign of
        dedication, self-giving, and love for the Church.
      </p>

      <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        Those who feel called to this path are listening to a deep inner longing
        to serve, lead, and share in Christ's mission. It is a path of faith,
        prayer, and formation—a lifelong journey with God at your side.
      </p>
