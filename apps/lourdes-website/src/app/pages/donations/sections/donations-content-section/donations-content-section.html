        The Lourdes Parish is more than just a building. It's a vibrant faith
        community where people gather to pray, celebrate, support, and grow. A
        place of encounter, hope, and comfort—right in the heart of South
        Rotterdam.

      <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        But to maintain this house of faith and hospitality, we need your help.

      <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        Every day we dedicate ourselves to liturgy, pastoral care, children's
        activities, elderly visits, catechesis, church building maintenance, and
        organizing beautiful services. Much of this is accomplished through the
        efforts of volunteers, but also with fixed costs for heating, lighting,
        maintenance, flowers, liturgical materials, and support for those in
        need.
